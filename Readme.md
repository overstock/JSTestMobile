# Overstock Candidate Assessment

## Instructions

This assessment consists of two parts. One is writing a correct Javascript implementation for a small function. A tests for this implementation are provided. Once the implementation has been written correctly, all tests will pass.

The second part consists of writing proper tests for an existing implementation. All aspects of the method need to be tested.

You will be cloning a GitHub repository and running a Grunt task to test code as you write it. Having Node.js installed is required to run the tests.

### Clone the repository
    git clone https://github.com/overstock/oco-candidate.git

### Install the dependencies
In the root directory of the project you've just cloned, run:

    npm install

Depending on your node install, you may have to have administrative/root permissions to run this command. Sometimes running.

    sudo npm install

and then entering your password is all that is required.

### Install a system-wide Grunt command
    npm install grunt -g

### Run the Grunt task
In the root directory of the project, run:

    grunt
